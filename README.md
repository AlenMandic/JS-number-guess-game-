# JS-number-guess-game-
A tutorial i followed on the Mozilla Developer Network,which i found interesting.

This is a simple number guessing game,where u guess a random generated number from 1 to 100.
Self-teaching myself currently on the Mozilla Developer Network tutorials is really fun,and this project was interesting and well-explained.
Big thumbs up to MDN.
